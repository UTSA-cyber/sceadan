2014-03-20  Basic  <simsong@Dance.local>

	* sceadan.c (vectors_finalize): removed __builtin_powi()s. They made the code hard to read and the non-portable speedup was negligible. 

2014-02-24  Basic  <simsong@r4.ncr.nps.edu>

	* sceadan.c: added <stdint.h>

2014-02-05  Simson Garfinkel  <simsong@mncrnpsedu.local>

	* main.c (process_file): sceadan now reads from stdandard input if specified with '-'

2014-01-23  Simson Garfinkel  <simsong@Dance.local>

	* main.c (parse_args): removed init_defaults(); variables are now initialized when they are defined, rather than defined uninitialized and initialized in a function.
	(main): removed time-based filenames that were not being used
	(parse_args): removed concurrency factor (since it wasn't being used)

	* sceadan.c (process_container): removed outs[] from entire code base.

	* sceadan_processblk.c (process_container): removed non-standard fd_t.
